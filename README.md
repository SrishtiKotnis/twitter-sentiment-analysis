Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project we analyze the tweets based on the polarity. Polarity analysis takes into account the amount of positive or negative terms that appear in a given sentence. 
It is useful to some extent, since it does a good job of structuring data sets.

Here we search for a particular topic(hashtag or any term) and give the number of tweets to be searched. Based on that we get the result in pie chart and percentage of positive, negative and neutral tweets.

Here we use TextBlob and Tweepy.

TextBlob
TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. 
It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

Tweepy
The Twitter API allows you to access the features of Twitter without having to go through the website interface.

(Further Improvement
Just considering  polarity for sentiment analysis is not enough. 
For proper analysis we should:
Clean the data
Process it
And then analyze it.)
